        <h1>SPENCER VARZANDEH Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
        <h2>First, the basics.</h2>
        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To learn how to utilize both HTML and CSS to design websites from scratch</li>
            <li>To be more confident with GitHub skills</li>
            <li>To learn efficient coding styles</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something in a line of text.</em></p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both</strong></em>.</p>
        
        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.</p>
        <p>Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>
        <p>Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images.</p>
        <p>It's important for accessibility.</p>
